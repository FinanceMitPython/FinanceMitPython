# Hello, I'm Han ðŸ‘‹
I'm a finance analyst with a background in finance, and I have a keen interest in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I learned programming by myself through online courses, and I'm focusing on combining finance with data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

## What I'm Currently Working On
I'm currently focusing on natural language processing and working with language models. Additionally, I'm implementing finance topics such as portfolio management and stock trading into data science to build better predictive models for investment decisions.

## How I Got Here
After studying finance, I became fascinated with the idea of using data science to improve financial analysis and decision-making. I taught myself programming through online courses and have been working on personal projects to combine finance with data science ever since.

## My Skills
- Data analysis and visualization using Python / R 
- Big data processing and analysis using tools such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark
- Data warehousing and ETL processes using tools such as Apache Kafka
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms such as regression, classification, clustering, and deep learning
- Experience working with databases such as MongoDB and PostgreSQL
- Proficient in data visualization tools such as PowerBI and Tableau
- Experience working with deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch
- Machine learning and deep learning techniques for predictive modeling
- Natural Language Processing and working with language models
- Financial modeling and analysis
